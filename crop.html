        "description": "Rice is a kharif crop which needs ample sunshine and water. Rice is a staple food for over half the world's population. It is a cereal grain and is primarily grown in tropical and subtropical regions. In India, rice is an integral part of the culture and diet, with states like West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab leading in production.",
        "climatic_conditions": "It needs warm and humid climate, and can grow on varied altitudes under suitable temperature. Since it needs plenty of water, monsoon lands are most suitable. Rice requires a warm and humid climate with a temperature range of 20°C to 40°C. It grows best in regions with an annual rainfall of 100-200 cm. During the growing season, consistent water supply through monsoon rains or irrigation is critical. The level of humidity should be high, and rainfall above 100cm is required for good crop.",
        "organic_fertilizer": "Compost, vermicompost, and green manure such as Sesbania and cow dung manure are effective organic fertilizers for rice. Azolla, a nitrogen-fixing aquatic fern, can also be used to enhance nitrogen levels in paddy fields. Rice farming required a very fertile land with a good water supply where seeds were sown to reap seedlings that once uprooted were planted in the fields to yield paddy.",
        "soil_type": "Clayey loam or alluvial soils with good water retention capacity are ideal for rice cultivation. The soil should be well-drained during the planting phase and waterlogged during the growth phase for optimal yield. Since it needs plenty of water, monsoon lands are most suitable. Fertile clayey or loamy soil are the best for rice cultivation. Deltas, flood plains, estuaries, river valleys and coastal plains are most suitable for rice cultivation.",

        "climatic_conditions": "Wheat grows best in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. The ideal temperature range for wheat cultivation is between 12°C and 18°C. It requires a cool growing season with an annual rainfall of 300-900 mm, depending on the region.",
        "organic_fertilizer": "Farmyard manure, compost, and green manures are effective organic fertilizers for wheat. A nitrogen-based fertilizer like blood meal or alfalfa meal may also be used.",
        "soil_type": "Loamy soil with good drainage and high organic matter is the best for wheat cultivation. The soil should be slightly alkaline with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0.",

        "climatic_conditions": "Sugarcane requires a hot, humid climate with temperatures between 20°C and 30°C. It thrives in areas with annual rainfall ranging from 1,200 mm to 2,000 mm. It needs consistent moisture and sunlight to grow.",
        "organic_fertilizer": "Manure such as compost, vermicompost, and green manure like sesbania and legumes are often used for sugarcane cultivation. It also benefits from nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea.",
        "soil_type": "Sugarcane requires deep, well-drained soils that are rich in organic matter. Loamy and sandy loam soils are ideal for sugarcane cultivation.",

        "climatic_conditions": "Cotton thrives in hot, dry climates with temperatures ranging from 21°C to 30°C. It requires 500-1,000 mm of rainfall per year and a frost-free period for optimal growth.",
        "organic_fertilizer": "Compost, farmyard manure, and green manure crops like legumes are common organic fertilizers for cotton cultivation. Organic fertilizers help in improving soil structure and fertility.",
        "soil_type": "Cotton grows best in well-drained, deep, sandy loam soils with a pH of 6.0 to 7.5. It prefers soils rich in organic matter with good moisture retention.",
